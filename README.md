# Text-detection-and-recognition-in-digital-videos
The main objective of this model is to recognize texts in digital videos, which includes characters, words, lines, paragraphs etc. To decode videos into frames and process each frame as a image.
To perform segmentation to identify images with text in them.
To build a model to detect the Region of Interest (ROI) and recognize the text in it.
